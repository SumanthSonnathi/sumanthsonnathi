## NABC

### Problem Statement
* Develop a model which can help to easy find the arsenic levels in water so that necessary action can be taken at the appropriate time which ensures appropriate water availablity to the public

### Need
* Model helps in finding the appropriate time to perform necessary action which ensures safe drinking water is provided to public

### Approach
* Model developed will predict the appropriate time dnamicaaly which takes the input from previous available data and also analyses the physical material and prides information at the appropriate time to perform necessary action

### Benefits
* Proposed model predicts the appropriate time to perform necessary action, a lot of cost will be saved since the water needs to be tested every day in the lab to measure the arsenic levels
* It also helps in expanding the availablity of appropriate water to the public due to the low cost implementation

### Alternatives
* Alternative of the proposed solution would be testing the water at regular intervals to measure the arsenic levels and calsulate the appropriate time for necessary action
